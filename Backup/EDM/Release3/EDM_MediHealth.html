         <font color="#226fa8" size="2"> As the economy continues to grow in Myanmar, one of the areas that has seen a major overhaul is the healthcare industry. The new government in Myanmar has increased government spending on its healthcare budget, a total 3.9% which is approximately $450 million USD of the government's budget in 2013 in comparison to 1.9% in 2012. The healthcare sector in Myanmar is also open to foreign investments with 70% of foreign ownership now being allowed in clinics and hospitals.<br />
          Healthcare spending in Myanmar is primarily being paid for by out of pocket (OOP) cost by the general public. According to the World Bank for 2012, OOP payments accounted for 92.7% of the total healthcare expenditures.  Their ability to pay for quality healthcare is directly related to the country's economic growth of which Asian Development Bank projects for 7.8% over the next two years. </font><br /></td>
